              <h2>Who we are</h2>
              <p>
                Roomy is an intuitive, budget-friendly interior design
                experience for beginners and experts alike. Roomy gives people
                comprehensive design inspiration, access to renowned experts,
                and help verbalizing their vision, so they can create the spaces
                they love.
              </p>
              <h3>Roomy's origin</h3>
              <p>
                Roomy began as a high-level course project. I was asked to
                create a product that enabled anyone, anywhere to chat with an
                expert in a field. There were certain functional requirements to
                begin with, but there was also a lot of room to create my own
                innovative approach. I chose to create an interior design
                responsive web app and was the UX Researcher and Designer for
                the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to create a product that was transformative in the
                services and experience it gave users, and to do so I put my
                user-focused foot forward!

              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>
                According to People magazine, over 70% of Americans plan on
                redecorating their homes after spending more time at home
                post-2020. Now imagine this. You come home from work, there's
                kids to care of, homework for your Masters program to complete,
                and you look around and say I dont like my space; I want to
                redecorate. Where do you start?
              </p>
              <p>
                People need help redesigning their spaces, but they need an
                intuitive, timely tool that does not break the bank. Roomy
                provides ample design inspiration, instant expert access, to
                integrate what they have, all in one place!
              </p>
            
           
          
          <!--end row holding 2 columns-->

          <!--The road and destination imgs-->

            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-4">
              <h3>The Road Ahead:</h3>
              <!--<p>With this project, I knew I would be wearing many hats, so I
                needed a road map to keep me moving forward.</p>-->

              <p>First, I had to research the problem space. Coupling
                information from competitors and potential users, I created
                user personas. I began building Roomy's
                information architecture based on my findings, and iterated on
                any glaring issues. From here, initial wireframes
                and a clickable prototype was developed which was
                iterated upon after usability testing and peer feedback.</p>

            <!--close 1st column-->

            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-4">
              <!--open 2nd column holding destination img-->
              <h3>The Desination:</h3>
              <p> With Roomy, I want to empower people with instant expert advice
                and quality tools, so they can create spaces they love while
                enjoying the process and not breaking the bank.</p>

            </div>
            <!--close second column-->
          </div>
          <!--end row holding 2 columns-->

          <h3>Understanding the Market</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge was to correctly understand the wants and
            expectations of the market. I needed to understand what
            successful competitors were doing and identify areas of
            opportunity where Roomy could distinguish itself. I chose Houzz
            and Havenly as they offered similar services and had market
            success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my analysis, I found an opportunity to create a guided
            interior design process, focused on customer and expert
            satisfaction, that tailored services to people's style and
            budget preferences.

          <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>
                Now that I understood the problem space, competitors, business
                constraints, and the app's high-level requirements and goals –
                there was still a human aspect missing! I needed to correctly
                identify and validate my target user. I interviewed people who
                had recently designed a space and had varying experience with
                online design tools. Interviews were a mix of in-person and
                remote recorded sessions in order to observe non-verbal cues.
                The insights I gained from these sessions were used to guide the
                design process and ensure a user-centered approach.

            <h3>Creating my Personas</h3>
            <p>
              At this point, I had a body of research to work with, but I needed
              to organize and personify these findings. To empathize with users,
              I needed to create personas that accurately embodied the needs,
              goals and motivations of users. I gathered the insights I gained
              from my user interviews and through affinity mapping, I began
              organizing my findings. I created two distinct personas I could
              refer to throughout the design process. From my primary persona,
              Sara, I found having personalized design inspiration was
              important.

            <p>
              At this point, I identified and validated my target audience in
              the form of my two personas, but I needed to understand how they
              would interact with Roomy. I mapped out user journeys to visualize
              how people find and interact with Roomy and to uncover
              opportunities for improvement. One opportunity I found
              was creating a structured way of organizing and matching experts
              to users.

              <h3>User Flows</h3>
              <p>
                Next, I created user flows. I wanted to visualize what
                decisions users would make along the way in to understand the
                functionality required to achieve key goals. In this stage, I
                was intentional about finding an intuitive "happy" path.

          <!--My challenges blurb-->
          
            <h3>My Challenges</h3>
            <p>In this phase I encountered two main issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deciding what path users would most likely follow</li>
              <li>
                Creating a user flow that was easy to follow and understand
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For the first issue, I made sure to reference my research. I went
              back to my personas and even looked at competitor apps. I looked
              at what my target audience said their needs/goals were and what
              they found challenging and let that lead my design process.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the second issue, I used Google. I looked at examples, read
              several articles, and looked at commonly used symbols used to
              communicate information. From here, I used Figma to create my user
              flows.
            </p>

          <!--Low fidelity sketches-->
          
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h3>
            <p>
              By now I had a sense of the organizational hierarchy which I
              iterated on using a closed card sort. Once I had a solid idea of
              the main content and features of the Roomy app, I began sketching.
              Pen and paper was a great way of quickly getting my ideas down on
              paper, while not holding me hostage to one idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began to create my initial wireframes for four of the app's main
              features. The features I focused on mirrored the user flows I
              created: adding an item to cart, creating a new
              inspiration folder, hiring an expert, and adding a new
              payment/address to profile.
            </p>

          <!--Wireframing & Prototyping-->
         
            <h3>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
              While I had the high-level functionality, I
              needed to gradually add more detail and interactivity into my
              screens. This increase in design fidelity lead to
              high-fidelity prototypes and eventually a clickable prototype I
              could use to test with users.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this process, I encountered challenges regarding
              confusing content and adding content too early in the
              design process. For example, both my low and mid-fidelity
              prototypes had a plus icon in the bottom navigation bar. This was
              confusing and repetitive as there was already another visible
              button that did the same function (creating a new project.) I
              removed this icon and consolidated the function. While you may
              want to include everything to make things clear, that can also
              lead to confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of adding content too early, I included UI elements early
              in my mid-fidelity prototypes. This ended up taking attention from
              high-level functionality concerns.
            </p>

              <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <p>
                Now that I created an interactive prototype for people to test
                out, I needed to create a strategic test plan to map out the
                goals and objectives beforehand. I identified the core tasks I
                wanted participants to test and began recruitment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I conducted a mix of remote and in-person moderated usability
                sessions with 5 participants. Tasks included adding an item to
                cart, creating a new inspiration folder, hiring an expert, and
                completing onboarding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once interviews were done, I analyzed my data via affinity
                mapping.

            <p>
              Using usability and subsequent preference
              test insights, I began refining my designs. This phase was
              about creating a coherent brand and visual design that aligned
              with the Roomy mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              I applied Gestalt and principles of design to refine my screens,
              created a cohesive Design System Language, and validated my
              designs with fellow designers.
            </p>

          <!--Final iteration blurb-->
          
            <h3>Final Iteration</h3>
            <p>
              I created a language that ensured consistency and cohesion across
              platforms, products, and features. I reached out to my design
              community and got feedback on my designs. From this collaboration,
              I adjusted text sizing, increased visibility on image text, and
              added a carousel feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the four iteration rounds, screens became more
              cohesive, consistent, and polished. The screens not only
              intuitively performed actions our personas needed but did so in a
              way that was visually appealing and echoed the Roomy brand.

          <!--Conclusion heading-->
          
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              From research to refining my designs, creating the Roomy app was a
              challenging yet rewarding experience. Throughout the process, I
              clarified what I was looking for, decided if my results matched my
              hypotheses, and weighed whether new information necessitated a
              change. My design drastically improved over time due to this
              intentional iteration. This ensured a useful AND time efficient
              product. Interestingly enough, this process mirrored many mental
              frameworks reinforced in cognitive and neuroscience making the
              design process a familiar stranger.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project also taught me the importance of finding balance.
              Each stage of the design process had different lessons to teach,
              so it's important to give each stage its due time. On the flip
              side, certain insights are only found by bringing everything
              together in the form of a prototype. Early testing is vital,
              because it starts the iteration process early, and saves time and
              money. Working in healthcare, particularly during COVID, I brought
              those lessons of balancing various demands into the design process
              and it helped me greatly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, iteration is one thing I can count on. I believe
              by bolstering community engagement in the form of a community
              page, blog, and more sharing options (i.e., style quiz results),
              more users will sign up and engage with Roomy. This can be tested
              by surveying existing users and gauging satisfaction. We could
              also conduct usability tests with versions of the app including
              increased community engagement measures. This could be
              transformative as it would attract people based on community not
              just the need to redecorate.
            </p>

                Design collaboration is great and even necessary, BUT you need
                balance. As I reviewed my feedback, I found there were some
                suggestions I loved, and some that didn’t fit. Being able to
                sift through that advice and compare it to your user research is
                a critical skill.

              <p>
                There are always going to be hitches along the way. During my
                usability sessions, I ran into technology and inexperience-based
                issues. The importance lies in remaining calm and thinking on
                your feet to ensure participants feel comfortable and you find a
                timely, working solution.

              <p>
                While I learned of several methods of testing user usability and
                preference, I also learned that sometimes testing reveals no
                difference. My preference testing revealed no statistically
                significant difference. I learned this finding is just as
                important as a clear difference.
