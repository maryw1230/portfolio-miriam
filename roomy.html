                        <p>Roomy began as a high-level course project. I was asked to create a product that enabled anyone, anywhere to chat with an expert in a field. There were certain functional requirements to begin with, but there was also a lot of room to create my own innovative approach. I chose to create an interior design responsive web app and was the UX Researcher and Designer for the project.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to create a product that was transformative in the services and experience it gave users, and to do so I put my user-focused foot forward!</p>

                        <p>According to People magazine, over 70% of Americans plan on redecorating their homes after spending more time at home post-2020. Now imagine this. You come home from work, theres kids to care for, homework for your Masters program to complete, and you look around and say I dont like my space; I want to redecorate. Where do you start?</p>
                        <p>People need help redesigning their spaces, but they need an intuitive, timely tool that does not break the bank. Roomy provides ample design inspiration, instant expert access, to integrate what they have, all in one place!</p>

                        <p>With this project, I knew I would be wearing many hats. The process would be long and wrought with new discoveries , so I needed a road map to keep me moving forward.</p>
                        <p>First, I had to research the problem space. I'd couple information from competitors and surveying potential users to better understand the market and its' expectations. With these insights, I'd create user personas that embodied the wants and needs of my target audience. I'd begin building Roomy's Information architecture based on my findings, and iterate on any glaring issues people found. From here, initial wireframes were created which developed into a clickable prototype that was iterated upon after usability testing and peer feedback.</p>

I chose Houzz and Havenly as they offered similar services and had market success.</p>
                        <p>Through my analysis, I found an opportunity to create a guided interior design process, focused on customer and expert satisfaction, that tailored services to people's style and budget preferences.</p>

                        <p>Now that I understood the problem space, competitors, business constraints, and the app's high-level requirements and goals – there was still a human aspect missing! I needed to correctly identify and validate my target user. I interviewed people who had recently designed a space and had varying experience with online design tools. Interviews were a mix of in-person and remote recorded sessions in order to observe non-verbal cues. The insights I gained from these sessions were used to guide the design process and ensure a user-centered approach.</p>

                    <p>At this point, I had a body of research to work with, but I needed to organize and personify these findings. To empathize with users, I needed to create personas that accurately embodied the needs, goals and motivations of users. I gathered the insights I gained from my user interviews and through affinity mapping, I began organizing my findings. I created two distinct personas I could refer to throughout the design process. From my primary persona, Sara, I found having personalized design inspiration was important.</p>

                <h3>User Journey </h3>
                <p>At this point, I identified and validated my target audience in the form of my two personas, but I needed to understand how they would interact with Roomy. I mapped out user journeys to better understand how people find and interact with Roomy and to uncover opportunities for improvement. Through this process, I was able to better understand the various scenarios where people would use the app and their accompanying expectations. One opportunity I found was creating a structured way of organizing and matching experts to users.</p>

               <div>
                <h3>My Challenges</h3>
                <p>In this phase I encountered two main issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deciding what path users would most likely follow</li>
                    <li>Creating a user flow that was easy to follow and understand</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the first issue, I made sure to reference my research. I went back to my personas and even looked at competitor apps. I looked at what my target audience said their needs/goals were and what they found challenging and let that lead my design process.</p>
                <p>For the second issue, I used Google. I looked at examples, read several articles, and looked at commonly used symbols used to communicate information. From here, I used Figma to create my user flows.</p>

               <!--Low fidelity sketches-->
               <div>
                <h3>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h3>
                <p>By now I had a sense of the organizational hierarchy which I iterated on using a closed card sort. Once I had a solid idea of the main content and features of the Roomy app, I began sketching. Pen and paper was a great way of quickly getting my ideas down on paper, while not holding me hostage to one idea.</p>
                <p>I began to create my initial wireframes for four of the app's main features. The features I focused on mirrored the user flows I created for my personas: adding an item to cart, creating a new inspiration folder, hiring an expert, and adding a new payment/address to profile.</p>

               <!--Wireframing & Prototyping-->
               <div>
                <h3>Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h3>
                <p>While I had the high-level functionality of the Roomy app, I needed to gradually add more detail and interactivity into my screens. This gradual increase in design fidelity lead to high-fidelity prototypes and eventually a clickable prototype I could use to test with users.</p>
                <p>During this process, I encountered some challenges regarding confusing content and adding certain content too early in the design process. For example, both my low and mid-fidelity prototypes had a plus icon in the bottom navigation bar. This was confusing and repetitive as there was already another visible button that did the same function (creating a new project.) I removed this icon and consolidated the function. While you may want to include everything to make things clear, that can also lead to confusion.</p>
                <p>In terms of adding content too early, I included UI elements early in my mid-fidelity prototypes. This ended up taking attention from high-level functionality concerns to honing in on the details way too early. I found giving adequate time to each step of the design process integral, because each part yields different information.</p>

                    <p>Using insights gained from my usability and subsequent preference tests, I was able to begin refining my designs. I needed to take the information I’d gathered and bring them together to create a cohesive and visually-attractive user interface. This phase was about creating a coherent brand and visual design that aligned with the Roomy mission.</p>
                    <p>I applied Gestalt and principles of design to refine my screens, created a cohesive Design System Language, and validated my designs with fellow designers.</p>

                    <p>I created a language that ensured consistency and cohesion across platforms, products, and features. I reached out to my design community and got feedback on my designs. From this collaboration, I adjusted text sizing, increased visibility on image text, and added a carousel feature.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of four iteration rounds, the screens became more cohesive, consistent, and polished. The screens not only intuitively performed actions our personas needed but did so in a way that was visually appealing and echoed the Roomy brand. This gradual iteration was an informative part of the process, because it showed me just how much goes into refining designs and how great the yield can be!</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion </h3>
                    <p>From research to refining my designs, creating the Roomy app was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Throughout the process, I clarified what I was looking for, decided if my results matched my hypotheses, and weighed whether new information necessitated a change. My design drastically improved over time due to this intentional iteration. This ensured a useful AND time efficient product. Interestingly enough, this process mirrored many mental frameworks reinforced in cognitive and neuroscience making the design process a familiar stranger.</p>
                    <p>This project also taught me the importance of finding balance. Each stage of the design process had different lessons to teach, so it's important to give each stage its due time. On the flip side, certain insights are only found by bringing everything together in the form of a prototype. Early testing is vital, because it starts the iteration process early, and saves time and money. Working in healthcare, particularly during COVID, I brought those lessons of balancing various demands into the design process and it helped me greatly.</p>
                    <p>Moving forward, iteration is one thing I can count on. I believe by bolstering community engagement in the form of a community page, blog, and more sharing options (i.e., style quiz results), more users will sign up and engage with Roomy. This can be tested by surveying existing users and gauging satisfaction. We could also conduct usability tests with versions of the app including increased community engagement measures. This could be transformative as it would attract people based on community not just the need to redecorate.</p>

                        <h3>01</h3>
                        <p>Design collaboration is great and even necessary, BUT you need balance. As I reviewed my feedback, I found there were some suggestions I loved, and some that didn’t fit. Being able to sift through that advice and compare it to your user research is a critical skill.</p>

                        <h3>02</h3>
                        <p>There are always going to be hitches along the way. During my usability sessions, I ran into technology and inexperience-based issues. The importance lies in remaining calm and thinking on your feet to ensure participants feel comfortable and you find a timely, working solution.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>03</h3>
                        <p>While I learned of several methods of testing user usability and preference, I also learned that sometimes testing reveals no difference. My preference testing revealed no statistically significant difference. I learned this finding is just as important as a clear difference.</p>
